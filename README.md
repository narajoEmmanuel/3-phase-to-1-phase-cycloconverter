### Project Overview
In power electronics, various configurations are employed to regulate voltage drop across loads and consequently power. This laboratory project focuses on the study of the cycloconverter and its characteristics. 

The analysis utilizes PSpice AD simulation to evaluate a three-phase to single-phase cycloconverter circuit, testing parameters such as:
- Voltage
- Power Factor (FP)
- Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)
- Efficiency under different loads

### Key Conclusions:
1. Harmonic distortion varies with the circuit topology.
2. PSpice simulations confirm the versatility of converters in supplying variable voltages and frequencies.
3. Harmonic behavior remains relatively stable across different loads and powers.
4. The cycloconverter enables direct AC power conversion between frequencies.
5. Strategic SCR firing angle adjustment achieved stable output voltages at 120 VRMS, regulating power delivery across frequencies.
